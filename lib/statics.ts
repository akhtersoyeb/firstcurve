export const STATIC_GENERATED_REPLY = "Hey, that's a question that's been on my mind a lot lately! I've been diving into user acquisition myself, and like you, I found \"Hooked\" super interesting but kinda abstract for immediate action. Besides \"Hooked,\" I'd suggest looking into \"Traction\" by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares. It's got a framework for identifying and testing different marketing channels. It's less about theory and more about practical steps you can take, which is exactly what I needed. I've also had some luck scouring Reddit in relevant subreddits. Finding real people with real problems you can solve is surprisingly effective, but it can be time-consuming. I've been exploring tools that help automate that process, actually. It's tricky finding ones that don't sound like a robot trying to sell something, though. Anyway, hope that helps! Good luck with your user acquisition journey! "
